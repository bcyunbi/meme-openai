# Meme with OpenAI

Before launching, add your OpenAI API key & GIPHY API key to the .env.local file, then`npm i` to install modules.

Use `npm run dev` to host locally @ `localhost:3000`. Or use `npm run build` and then `npm run start` to preview the public build. Push up to a free Vercel account to host it and share it with the world.
